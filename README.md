# MIDiWay

MIDiWay is a simple midi translation layer build to support extra features on a Behringer X-Touch that most programs don't support like the LCD or 7-Segment displays. Or more complex features such as banking.

It is build in pure C and uses the GTK framework to support both Linux and Windows.

MIDiWay is a word play between MIDI (Which it obvously uses) and Midway as it is designed to run in between the phisical midi controller via USB MIDI and recieving software such as Mydmx3.
